      Thoughts of XXI century artist
      </h3>
      <h3 class="desc">
        Thank you for your interest!
        <p>
        I am trurly proud to share a demo-version of my book in Russian language. 
        </p><p>
        This little book is a mix of my thoughts and personal experience. 
        <p>As always traveling artist, I got some ideas to share.</p>
        <p> Modern art is very confusing, even artists aren't always confident.
        </p>
       The full version of book is available in two languages: Russian and English.
       <p> Please, contact me for getting full version. </p>
        <p> 
         Prepare a cup of tea and some chocolate, hope you'll enjoy it.</p>
